PROGRESSIVE WEB APPS

PWA development is a set of optimal software development practices aimed at making a web application function similarly to a mobile app: app-like navigation and excellent visual content. 

PWAs send push notifications and have an icon on the home screen. At the same time, progressive web applications are simpler and faster than traditional mobile apps, and they can be shared through a URL.

This is implemented with the help of javascript files, called service workers, which enable offline execution of the app and offline information storage.

Advantages: faster page load, simple, easy install, cross platform, cached data for offline experience, cheaper and faster to develop than full app, can bypass app store submission process.

Disadvantages: cannot be found in app stores, limited functionality on apple, different pwa's cannot share data with each other as they are isolated
