## Time estimations
The rule of thumb is to add 50% on top of all your projections. The key part is to get a precise picture of all the requirements. A simple task may be much more complex then originally anticipated and that can turn a one day task into an entire week. 

## Getting familiar with existing code base
To get really comfortable, count on 3 months
- ask questions about what is needed: database and tools
- check the dependency tree in package.json and identify key packages
- start analyzing the code at *the most used part of the application*: which network requests are being made; store urls; entry points of the system; link from entrypoint to database.
