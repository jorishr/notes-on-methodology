# Application Lifecycle

1. Idea and proof of concept
   
    Create a minimum viable product with the essence of the product and get feedback.

2. Beta phase

    A decent looking fully working version to get the early adopters excited.

3. Scaling

    Target exponential user growth.     Additional features can be added and as the complexity grows more attention should go to good coding practices.

4. Corporate
   
    Now there is an established product that is sustainable. Focus on improving code and quality of the product.
