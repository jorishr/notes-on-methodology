1. learn the patterns
2. learn when to apply them and when NOT to. Don't obsess about them, they are a tool to make code more predictable and clean. Not an end in itself.

SEE GITHUB REPO FOR EXAMPLES

NULL OBJECT PATTERN

Often you have to write lots of if-statements to check whether an image is present or whether a user is logged in or not.

This can be simplied by using a null object which replaces the NULL with default data.

BUILDER PATTERN
Suitable for working with objects that have lots of optional properties and for very complex object with properties that form objects themselves.

You reduce the base constructor function to only contain the required properties. For example, username.

Inside the builder function your first construction is to build the username using the previous base constructor.

Next you add various methods for the optional properties.
