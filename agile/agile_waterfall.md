# Agile vs waterfall
The debate about which workflow to use is endless. What type of approach that is used, is usually a reflection of the values of the people involved. In practice this may come down to the choice or preference of the HIPPO: the highest Paid Person Opinion. The truly crucial issue here is the ability of the people involved to have open and clear communication so they can find a tweaked approach that works for them.

Some opinion by a senior dev from the internet:
- Agile is optimized for doing the minimum amount of work on every turn. You can iterate quicker (Time To Market) and need less foresight and planning sessions. The downside is that in practice it becomes very hard to get this right. Usually quick and bad decision-making accumulates and over time you get bad code on top of bad code.
- Waterfall can lead to the best quality code if you have *good people* with a solid understanding of what is required. You need strong foresight. The downside is the big upfront investment in planning sessions that requires the involvement of all the developers.
