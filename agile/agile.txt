AGILE

A resume of Agile: you focus on an iterative process whereby each iterations produce a minimally viable progression or addition. After each sprint the client gets an output they can comment upon. 

This is great for consultancies as they try to make the client happy on each interaction.

The problem may be that there is not enough overall vision or strategy. 


WORKSHOP: AGILE INSIDE OUT BLUEPRINT, by Gary Straughan, Development that pays.


STEP I: GET SPECIFIC WITH AN AGILE FRAMEWORK
You pick either SCRUM or KANBAN

STEP II: GET COMPLETE (NOT PERFECT)
See checklist for either SCRUM OR KANBAN. SCRUM is more widely adopted, KANBAN has less 'tasks' and 'roles' to be performed.

STEP III: GET VISUAL
List the things to do. 
Split the things "in progress" into DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT, TESTING
Before they are moved into DONE.

STEP IV: GET CONSTRAINT
The work in progress needs to be limited. As a team you have to figure out what you are capable of delivering. This capacity is limited and should be taken seriously, don't overestimate or brag about.

STEP V: GET PREDICTABLE
From an organizational prespective predictability is important, more so then fast delivery. Predictably putting out results is key,
HORIZONTAL SLICING
Sprint one: database; 
Sprint two: back-end; 
Sprint three: front-end;

The problem with approach is that the customer only gets to see something after three sprint cycles.

VERTICALLY SLICING
In the first sprint you do some rudimentary work on database, back-end and front-end to get something out to the customer and in subsequent sprints you refine the product.

STORY SLICING
Is to combination: “What are some options for delivering value to a customer as soon as possible?”
EXAMPLE
Asking the question: “What are some options for delivering to a customer the ability to pay bills online as soon as possible?” leads to uncovering customer-centric, independently implementable and valuable capability options such as “by BPAY, by credit card, by direct debit”. 
We can then judge and pick the simplest and quickest of the more precise options, and ask the same question again: “What are some options for delivering to a customer the ability to pay bills online using BPAY as soon as possible?”
