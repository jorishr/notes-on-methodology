## Kanban
Kanban a visual process management tool. Items, user stories, can be processed by pulling them from the back log and, when a stage is completed, be pulled to the next stage.

Backlog -> Planning/coordination -> design -> develop -> accept

KANBAN (visual card in Japanese) can be combined with SCRUM/AGILE but does not require to have sprints and can works as a continuous process whereby a new item is pulled-out when done and a new item can be pulled from the back-log to be incorporated.

The key is to limit the work in progress in relation to the capacity of the team. Usually, the number of team members + 50%.

### Lean 
Lean comes from lean manufacturing principles whereby you focus primarily on those features that matter for what the end-user is using the product for. For example, you can load a page with tons of design css animations but if none of them really help the end-user to complete the purchase process then those features should not be given much time and attention.  

### Kanban board
A feature will go through a process: definition, build, review, testing, merge to master, done.

After a feature is created you are going to have a meeting or GROOMING session for that feature whereby you break the feature into smaller tasks and formulate a number of questions that come to mind about the specifics layout and functionality of the feature.

Once a task is completed you ADD PULL REQUEST ON GITHUB so someone can look at your code.
