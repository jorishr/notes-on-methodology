# Software Licensing

FOSS: Free and open source software

Free to use, modify and redistribute.
- MIT License: most permissive, basically you can do what you want with it
- GPL: obliged to always keep your modifications open to the community
- Business source: free to use, after a certain time period. Prevents copy-cat behavior from VC firms or corporations during the early stages of a product.

An interesting case is Start9. They prohibit commercial use of the software during the development stages (first years) and plan to go full open source once the project has matured.

The software license is a tool not and end in itself. The choice depends on the trade-offs that are being made. Some considerations to keep in mind:
- code should be auditable and available for review
- how important is protection against a government attack?
- usually it's beneficial to allow the community to help you or your company
- public distribution of the code could be an insurance policy against the core development going rogue.
