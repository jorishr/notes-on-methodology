# Progressive web apps
PWA development is a set of optimized software development practices aimed at making a web application function similarly to a mobile app with app-like navigation and streamlined visual content. 

PWAs can send push notifications and can be have an icon on the home screen. At the same time, progressive web applications are simpler and faster than traditional mobile apps as they can be shared through a URL.

This is implemented with the help of service workers, Javascript modules which enable offline execution of the app and offline information storage.

## Advantages
- faster page load, 
- simple and easy 'install', 
- cross platform, 
- cached data for offline experience, 
- cheaper and faster to develop than full scale app, 
- bypass app store submission process

## Disadvantages 
- cannot be found in app stores, 
- limited functionality on Apple devices
- pwa's cannot share data with each other as they are isolated apps
